# NED - A NES ROM sprite editor #

## Usage ##

Just type `python ned.py` to load the GUI. You can then load NES roms. The
left-hand side panel allows you to see the sprites in your rom. The right-hand
side panel allows you to manipulate puzzles. You can then drag and drop
sprites from the left-hand side panel to your puzzles (and vice-versa). Once
you are done, you can dump the rom plus puzzles to a dump file so that you can
reload it later.
